        <p class="card-body">
            My research lies at the intersection of <strong>data mining</strong>, <strong>database systems</strong>,
            and <strong>machine learning</strong>, with a particular focus on scalable algorithms for
            large-scale and high-dimensional data. I develop fundamental methods that improve the
            efficiency, robustness, and interpretability of data-driven systems.

            My recent work explores three main directions:
        </p>

        <ul class="ordered-list">
            <li>
                <strong>Outlier Detection:</strong>
                Designing oblique-subspace hashing frameworks that generalize beyond traditional axis-parallel
                methods. My OS-Hash algorithm enables efficient outlier detection over arbitrary data types,
                including time-series and graph-structured datasets, yielding significant speedups and higher
                recall compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Spectral Clustering:</strong>
                Developing stochastic optimization techniques to overcome the memory bottleneck of classical
                spectral clustering. My BSpec framework replaces the O(n²) similarity-matrix construction with
                an efficient stochastic factorization pipeline, supporting scalable clustering with
                out-of-sample embeddings.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search:</strong>
                Building learning-based optimization layers for HNSW graphs by modeling node and edge visitation
                statistics across queries. This allows dynamic reconstruction of upper-layer graph structures,
                leading to faster convergence toward nearest neighbors and improved query performance.
            </li>
        </ul>
